                This week Maciek touched basics about <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. In <strong>HTML</strong> I learned about basic TAGs and general structure of <strong>HTML</strong>. Regarding <strong>CSS</strong> I know how to attach <strong>CSS</strong> style sheet to <strong>HTML</strong> how to implicate style in <strong>HTML</strong> document booth in <em>HEAD</em> or <em>BODY</em> part. Now thanks <strong>CSS</strong> I can change view of page faster and more efficient. We used validator to exanimate our code. We learned about devtool in google chrome and how it use and change look of website. At the end Maciek showed us useful tool to plan our tasks- <em>KANBAN</em> and recommend trello page to use it.
