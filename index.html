			<p>
				My name is Tom and I am 34 years old. Personally I am married to a wonderful woman and owner of a great
				dog. I am co-owner of a micro company but the truth is that in my heart, coding is a desire I want to
				lead. I feel it. So this is the reason for this course. I want to change my whole life and be happy.

					The <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> or <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup
					language for documents designed to be
					displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as <strong>Cascading Style
						Sheets
						(CSS)</strong> and scripting languages such as <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

					<strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the
					presentation of a
					document written in a markup language such as <strong>HTML</strong> or <strong>XML</strong>
					(including XML dialects such as SVG,
					MathML or XHTML).[1] <strong>CSS</strong> is a cornerstone technology of the <em>World Wide
						Web</em>, alongside <strong>HTML</strong> and
					<strong>JavaScript</strong>.[2]

				<p>
					JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the
					core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
					JavaScript on the client side for webpage behaviour,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
					All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
