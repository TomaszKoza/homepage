				My name is Tom and I am 34 years old. Personally I am married to a wonderful woman and owner of a great
				dog. I am co-owner of a micro company but the truth is that in my heart, coding is a desire I want to
				lead. I feel it. So this is the reason for this course. I want to change my whole life and be happy.

					<strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the
					presentation of a

					JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the
					core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
					JavaScript on the client side for webpage behaviour,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
					All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
