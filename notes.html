                    CamelStyle and pascalStyle. Thanks to lesson about <strong>HTML</strong> protocol I understand

                    <em>live server</em>. In case of classes I learned what is <em>BEM</em> (Block Element Modifier) and
                    how to use this concept to name <em>classes</em> in <strong>CSS</strong>. There were many
                    information about positioning, displaying and owerflowing. Also box-model concept was introduced.
