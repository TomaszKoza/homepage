				<h3>HTML</h3>
				<p>
					The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
					displayed in a web browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets
					(CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

				<h3>CSS</h3>
				<p>
					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
					document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG,
					MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
					JavaScript.[2]

				<h3>JavaScript</h3>
				<p>
					JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the
					core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use
					JavaScript on the client side for webpage behaviour,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries.
					All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
