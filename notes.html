                    <strong>HTML</strong> how to implicate style in <strong>HTML</strong> document booth in
                    <em>HEAD</em> or <em>BODY</em> part. Now thanks <strong>CSS</strong> I can change view of page
                    faster and more efficient. We used validator to exanimate our code. We learned about devtool in
